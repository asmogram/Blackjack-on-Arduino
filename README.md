# Blackjack-on-Arduino
Interactive embedded system in C language on Arduino UNO
The system was built in Tinkercad

The game Blackjack which is simply 21 is gambling game for 2 players. 
Those whose number is bigger but less or equal to 21 wins. 
In the code we set the button to add numbers and the sensor to finish game. 
After that the program compares the results and give us output, which is "win" or "lose".
In case of winning the screen goes green and there is a light sequence going forward. 
In case of lose the screen goes green and the buzzer works. 
After each game it restarts automatically and we can start the game again. 

Important to mention: the display is not on tinkercad as it is not compatible with this website, but it works on the circuit
